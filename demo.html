            <strong>Over the years, experts have identified two major problems in Bangladesh's banking sector</strong>. The first is that we have too many banks, owned by a group of influential people. Many of these banks have repeatedly approved loans to subsidiary companies of other bank owners or people associated with them, who are among the major loan defaulters in our country. This is connected to the second problem, which is the massive growth of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking sector. Both are the results of the policies taken by our regulators, or have happened due to their inaction.

            <br>

            In a recent move, the Bangladesh Bank decided to permit banks not to treat borrowers as defaulters if they repaid only 15 percent (or more) of their total loan instalments payable—down from 25 percent in 2020. Additionally, banks were permitted to transfer the unrealised interest on the 85 percent (or less) of the loans to their income books—up from 75 percent the year before—even if the sums were not paid. Because of this relaxed policy, borrowers remained unclassified by paying only 15 percent of their loan amounts for the year. And banks were able to lower their provision requirement, which raised most banks' operating profits in 2021.

            According to experts, the high operating profit logged by banks did not reflect the real figure, which is giving an unrealistic picture—a dangerous thing for banks. The most glaring problem here is that there is no way that banks will actually realise the whole amount they are still owed—some of which they have already included in their operating profits for 2021. That is simply not how the banking system works anywhere in the world. And banks in Bangladesh have an even poorer track record when it comes to recovering such funds—which got worse after the pandemic. Therefore, the banks' balance sheets have become increasingly more detached from reality.

            <u>Second, by inflating their incomes this way, banks are overstating their profits and are creating the scope for paying higher dividends to their owners and shareholders, without really making any extra earnings to pay their shareholders from.</u> Even though the central bank has said it has directed banks to refrain from distributing dividends as an extra precaution, one wonders whether the central bank or the commercial banks will actually follow through with this, given their poor track record of abiding by their own set of rules.
